## CIS3330-CODE2-Guessing-Game-Number-Alpha

### Instructions

In the following code assignment, you are going to create an **interactive number guessing game**, in which the user has **three attempts** to **guess a random number from 1 to 10**. Furthermore, the game must tell the user if their guess was lower or higher than the number to be guessed.

### Use the following prompts to the user

* Welcome the user to the game: 
  - **"\nWelcome to the Guessing Game"**
* Request user a guess: 
  - **"\nEnter your guess from one to ten: "** (note space after the colon)
* Inform the user when the guess was right: 
  - **"Hooray! You guessed the number: x"** (replace x with the guessed number)
* Inform the user when the guess was wrong
  - If the guess was higher than the number: 
    + **"Your guess (x) was a little too high. Try lower."** (replace x with the guess number)
  - If the guess was lower than the number: 
    + **"Your guess (x) was a little too low. Try higher."** (replace x with the guess number)
  - If the user fails to guess in three tries: 
    + **"Your failed to guess the number (x) in three attempts."** (replace x with the number to be guessed)
    
**Important:** Do not forget to program your code in code_2.py and start your code at line 10. Be careful not to code inside the if statement defined in line 5
